Audio Processing I set the folder anf file paths for the audio files. Then I load the audios in variables for easy access. After that i loaded the files and play some sample audio files. Then i check the magnitude frequency of the audio files named Morning1, Morning2 and evening1. The last step is to check the mean difference of the audio files.
